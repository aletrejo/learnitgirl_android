# MeTime App Description

Quick description: MeTime lets you select different activities to relax based on  how much free time you have. 

## Main activities in the app:
* Add, edit and delete activities
* Select an activity based on the amount of free time you have
* Block phone while activity is ongoing
* Display dashboard with analytics about how much me-time you’ve given yourself
* Setting goals of how much free-time you want to give yourself per week

## ADD, EDIT AND DELETE ACTIVITIES
The user has the ability to add their own relaxing activities. When they select add new activity they will have to fill out a form that asks them for the name of the activity and how much time it takes (there are going to be 4 available options: 5 mins, 15 mins, 30 mins and 1 hour). 

When the user first downloads the app there will already be some existing activities like doing yoga, dancing, walking in a park, etc. These activities + the ones the users has added can be deleted or edited. 

## SELECT AN ACTIVITY
When the user has some free time they will select an activity. The app will ask them how much free time they have (5 mins, 15 mins, 30 mins, 1 hour) and then based on their selection it will display them the activities that take that duration they’ve selected. Out of this list, the user will select one activity and press start. 

## BLOCK PHONE WHILE ACTIVITY IS ONGOING 
As soon as the user has started an activity, the app will ask them to put down their phone. It will be able to detect if the user is using their phone and it will send them a reminder to continue the activity they chose. 

## DISPLAY ANALYTICS DASHBOARD
The users will be able to know how much me-time they’ve given themselves by looking at  a bar graph that plots how much time they’ve spent on the me-time activities. There will be three different views: daily, weekly and monthly. 

## GOAL SETTING
At the start of the week users can set themselves goals for how much time they want to give to themselves to relax during that week. This goal will be displayed as a horizontal line in the bar graph so users can see how close are to reaching their goal.
